views = "./page/html"
# html static public files
public = "./page/public"

# http session configure
[session]
name = ""
maxAge = 0
keys = []

# mongodb configure
[mongodb]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 27017
dbname = "console"
document = [
  "admin",
  "log",
  "system",
  "cluster"
]

# mongodb auth configure
# !when you need to fill in the certification
[mongodb.auth]
user = ""
password = ""

# redis configure
[redis]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 6379
password = ""

# crypto configure
[crypto]
type = "aes256"
key = ""

# email service configure
[nodemailer]
service = "smtp.qq.com"
host = "smtp.qq.com"
port = 465
secureConnection = true
secure = true

# email service auth configure
[nodemailer.auth]
user = ""
pass = ""

# intel webrtc mcu listen configure
[service]
port = 88
router = "/masterApi"

# log configure
[log]
path = "./mcu.log"
```

Save this configuration file.
next.
You need to create a new default management account in the database.

```console

```

or use pm2

```console
~ pm2 start mcu.js -i auto
```

Now please start enjoying!
